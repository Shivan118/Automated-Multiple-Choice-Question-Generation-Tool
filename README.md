# Automated Multiple-Choice Question Generation Tool

### Project Overview

AutoGenMCQ is an innovative tool designed to automate the process of generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from textual data. The primary objective of this project is to enhance educational content creation and assessment practices by leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI and providing users with a user-friendly interface. Through integration with Streamlit, the system offers a seamless experience for uploading text data, generating MCQs, and downloading the output in CSV format.

### Problem Statement

Manual generation of multiple-choice questions from textual data is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Educators and content creators often face challenges in creating assessments that accurately assess understanding and knowledge retention. AutoGenMCQ addresses these challenges by automating the MCQ generation process, thereby saving time and effort. Additionally, the tool aims to ensure scalability and performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of text data or generating numerous MCQs simultaneously.

### Key Features
